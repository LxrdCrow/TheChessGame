# ChessGame-py

A simple chess game implementation in Python, designed to provide a clean and interactive command-line chess experience.

> ðŸ’¡ *This project was born from my passion for chess and programming.*  
> It represents the foundation of a long-term goal â€” building a fully functional online chess platform in the future.  
> Through this project, I aim to merge strategic thinking with clean software design, learning how to bring complex logic to life through Python.

## Introduction

**ChessGame-py** is a Python-based chess engine that blends the timeless strategy of chess with the logical power of programming.  
Built around **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, it demonstrates how complex systems â€” like the rules, state, and dynamics of a chess game â€” can be modeled through well-structured classes and interactions.

By developing this project, one learns not only about chess mechanics, but also about **software architecture**, **game logic design**, and **algorithmic reasoning**. Each component â€” from move validation to board representation â€” offers insights into concepts such as:

- **Encapsulation and modularity:** Each piece, move, and rule is isolated in its own class, showing how to manage complexity in scalable codebases.
- **State management:** The board, players, and turns are all dynamic objects that interact in a constantly evolving system.
- **Combinatorial logic and rule enforcement:** Validating chess moves requires understanding possible combinations and logical constraints â€” a great exercise in conditional and algorithmic thinking.
- **Integration with Pygame:** While starting from a command-line interface, this project also explores how Pythonâ€™s `pygame` library can bring graphical interactivity and event-driven programming to the experience.

Ultimately, **ChessGame-py** is not just a chess game â€” itâ€™s a training ground for writing clean, maintainable, and intelligent Python code that reflects real-world design patterns and problem-solving techniques.


## Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:
- Implement a fully functional chess game with standard rules
- Create a clear and user-friendly command-line interface
- Demonstrate good programming practices and code organization
- Provide a platform for learning and experimenting with chess game logic
